Operations of CryptoKitties:
- If you own 2 Kitties, you can use either of them as the sire (father) and the dam (mother).
- To breed with other kittens you don’t own, then first the owner of the kitty who will be the sire must authorize their kitten (which is not gestating) to be a sire approveSiring.
- Use this website (Browse) to find other kitties.
- Then, the mother (dam) is gonna breedWith the sire.
- Last step on this dance, the mom is going to giveBirth to new CryptoKitties!

How to Breed:
Metamask + MyEtherWallet > Rinkeby (infura.io)
1. Go to MyEtherWallet
2. Select Rinkeby (infura.io) from the top-right menu
3. Copy and paste the contract address and the ABI from this GitHub Gist file

Here is a list of the methods and what they do, in a order that would make sense to call them:
function paused() constant

Just mentioning it for peace of mind. The contract won’t be paused while the Alpha is running.
function getKittiesOf(address addr) constant

Pass in your address as a string to get the list of all kitty ids that you own. Pretty handy, eh? Every participant should start with 2.
function getKitty(uint256 id) constant

Pass in the Id of any kitten, it returns an array with all of its attributes.
function kittyCount() constant

Just a count of all kittens existing in the game
function approveSiring(uint256 sireId, uint256 momId)

The first param is a kitty you own. The second is the kittyId that you you are authorizing to be the mom.
function breedWith(uint64 myKittyId, uint64 sireId)

The first param is the kitty you own, and the second is either another kitty you own, or a kitty which the owner approved siring with your soon-to-be mom cat.
function giveBirth(uint256 momId)

Ahhh the joy of birth! Call this function with a pregnant kitty you own. After calling this function, if it all goes well, then your kitty will be born and will belong to you. To figure out which is your new kitty ID, call the constant function `getKittiesOf`; the newborn will be the last one in that list.
function transfer(address _to, uint _kittyId) public

If you want to transfer a kitty to someone else. Transfer a kitty you own, to any address. Requires you to own the kitty, and the contract must not be in paused state
